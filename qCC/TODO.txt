*** And from the forum topic 'recent requests' ***

Big ones:
[*] 3D space mouse management
[*] Cross section tool
[*] flythrough mode (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=179&p=607#p607)

Various:
[*] Per-point size based on SF values (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=507)
[*] Select ASCII files output precision (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=509&p=1245#p1245)
[*] Add a header to the begining of an ASCII file (column names)
[*] Display ortho-rectified images as high-res textures (instead of point clouds!)
[*] Use PDAL instead of libLAS (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=437&p=1014#p1014)
[*] Run the PCV plugin on more than one file at a time (or batch process)
[*] Command line mode could be extended (more methods, etc.)
[*] Add 'GL filter' plugins support to ccViewer

From Dimitri L.:
[*] Auto-detect header format in ASCII files (in any) 
[*] Compute distances in a given direction (cylinder)
[*] Compute signed distances between clouds
[*] Being able to apply various methods based on a sub-sampled cloud
[*] Vector fields (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?f=14&t=201&p=614#p614)

From Thomas D.:
[*] Uniformize color-scales of mutliple clouds
[*] Show/hide points based on their normal (http://www.danielgm.net/cc/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=168&p=488#p488)

From AdrienA:
[*] Radiance scaling shader

From Chartzell:
[*] A limit box- Being able to hide portions of the clouds you are working on can make the registration process much quicker and easier. With a customizable limit box you can look at just a small cross section of the clouds to get a good view of how well they fit together and what adjustments need to be made. Ideally, you would be able to push and pull on the various sides of the box to change it's dimensions.
[*] Ability to do fly around animations and export them to some type of video format? Something where you could set various viewpoints and and have the camera fly between each point. Google SketchUp has a great example of this function. (see 'flythrough mode' above)

From Jean-Francois H.: 
[*] Exporting histogram as image

From Konrad W.:
[*] Something like the plane shader from point tools where the depth is coloured with the Hue channel

From Rav M.:
[*] Aligning camera (perpendicularly to a face) by chosing 3 points/vertexes or group of points
[*] Add front and back cutting plane
[*] move and rotate global coordinate (X,Y,Z) or aligning it like camera and then adding another parts to correct scene in right place.

From Gianluca C.:
[*] find a way to transfer the colors from the pointcloud to the Poisson reconstructed surface (qPoissonRecon)
[*] to overlay an image over the mesh with some common points and "drape" the photo on the surface
