Description: 3D point cloud and mesh processing software
 CloudCompare is 3D point cloud (and triangular mesh) 
 processing software. It has been designed to 
 perform comparisons between two 3D points clouds 
 (such as the ones obtained with a laser scanner) 
 or between a point cloud and a triangular mesh. 
 .
 It relies on a specific octree structure that enables 
 great performance in this particular function and is 
 intended to deal with huge point clouds 
 (typically more than 10 million points, 
 and up to 120 million with 2 Gb of memory)
