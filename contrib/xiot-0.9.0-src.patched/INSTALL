                Building and Installing X3DLoader library
===============================================================================


Build System Dependencies
=========================

   The X3DLoader library uses the CMake build system to generate a
   platform-specific build environment. To build this from the 
   CMakeLists.txt files you will need following tool:
   
   Kitware CMake 2.6.0 or newer
   
   If you don't already have CMake installed on your system you can get
   it from:

   http://www.cmake.org/


Basic Installation
==================

	You should create an out-of-source build directory and run cmake from 
	there. The advantage to this approach is that the temporary files created
	by CMake won't clutter the source directory.

	In a directory alongside the X3DLoader library use:

		mkdir build
		cd build
		cmake ../x3dloader -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
		make

	The build system will check if all necessary dependencies are met. If not
	it will	inform you on missing dependencies. Please also refer the 
	Prerequisites section in the "README" file for dependend libs and where to
	grab it.
	
	On windows you can use the CMake GUI tool. Skip "make" if you generated
	Visual Studio project files.
	
	Please also refer to the CMake documentation for detailed informations on
	how to use the CMake build system.
