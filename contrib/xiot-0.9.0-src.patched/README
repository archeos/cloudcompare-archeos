XIOT - The X3D I/O Toolkit library 

About
=====

	This library provides an open source generic C++ toolkit to import and
	export X3D in its differents XML encodings : ASCII and binary. A special
	development was done to provide a FI (FastInfoset) based X3D encoding.
	
	See project homepage for more details:

Credits
=====
	This project was lead by Actor3D and funded by EDF R&D in the context of 
	the COLLAVIZ project with the financial support of the French National 
	Research Agency (ANR-08-COSI-003)

Prerequisites
=============
	XIOT requires XercesC or Expat XML parser and zlib compression library to
	build. You can choose your favourite XML parser using the
	XML_PARSER_SELECTION option for CMake.
	
	XercesC
	=======
	The Apache XML parser library is contained in the contrib directory for
	win32 and win64 build with VC9. On Linux system, XercecC can easily be 
	obtained using the package system, i.e. via:
	
	sudo apt-get install libxerces27 libxerces27-dev
	
	If not, consult the following URI to get binaries or the source for 
	XercesC:
	http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/
	
	The library has been tested with Xerces versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.0.

	Expat
	=======
	The Expat XML parser library is contained in the contrib directory for
	win32 build with VC9. On Linux system, Expat can easily be 
	obtained using the package system, i.e. via:
	
	sudo apt-get install libexpat1 libexpat-dev
	
	If not, consult the following URI to get binaries or the source for 
	Expat:
	http://expat.sourceforge.net/
	
	The library has been tested with Expat version 2.0.1
	
	zlib
	====
	The zlib compression library is packaged with many systems. Static builds
	for win32/64 build with VC are contained in the contrib directory. On Linux 
	systems, zlib can easily be obtained using the package system, i.e. via:
	
	sudo apt-get install zlib1g zlib1g-dev
	
	If not, consult the following URI to get binaries or the source for 
	zlib:
	http://www.zlib.net/
	
	The library has been tested with zlib version 1.2.3.
	
	For additional prerequisites for the example viewer and for the ParaView
	plugin please refer to the README files in subdirectories example and 
	plugins.
