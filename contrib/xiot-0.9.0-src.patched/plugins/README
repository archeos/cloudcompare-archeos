X3DLoader plugin examples

About
=====
	This directory contains examples on how to use the X3DLoader library
	in a plugin for ParaView.

Prerequisites
=============
	The plugin depends on ParaView since IT IS a plugin for ParaView.
	
	You need a self compiled ParaView, that has been conifgured with following
	options:
	
	BUILD_SHARED_LIBS: ON
	PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI: ON
	
	
	on the VTK version 5.0 or newer,
	which is not included with this source package. On Linux system, VTK 
	can easily be obtained using the package system, i.e. via:
	
	sudo apt-get install libvtk5 libvtk5-dev
	
	Depending on your distribution it can be necessary to have also the 
	development versions of JPEG, TIFF and PNG installed.
	
	If you can not install VTK via your package system or on Windows, consult
	the following URI to get binaries or the source for VTK:
	http://www.vtk.org/
	
Installation
============
	The compilation and installation of the plugin is a little tricky:

	1. You have to turn ON both options BUILD_X3DLOADER_EXAMPLES and 
	   BUILD_PARAVIEW_PLUGIN in your cmake configuration. See the "README"
	   file in the example directory on how to build the X3DLoader examples
	2. You have to specify the location of your ParaView build using 
	   ParaView_DIR.
	3. The ParaView you build the plugin against has to be build with shared 
	   libraries (BUILD_SHARED_LIBS).
	4. For your ParaView build and for the plugin GUI you need to build 
	   ParaView using QT (PARAVIEW_BUILD_QT_GUI).

Usage
=====
	Be sure that the plugin reaches all dependent libraries on it's own. You 
	can test this using ldd on Linux or depends on Windows. Use the ParaView 
	Plugin Manager to load the plugin. Then you will find a X3D file filter 
	using File->Open.
