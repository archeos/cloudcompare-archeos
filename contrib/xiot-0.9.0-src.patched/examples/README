X3DLoader library examples

About
=====
	This directory contains examples on how to use the X3DLoader library.
	Until now this is just the small app "vtkX3DLoader"

Prerequisites
=============
	The application vtkX3DLoader depends on the VTK version 5.0 or newer,
	which is not included with this source package. On Linux system, VTK 
	can easily be obtained using the package system, i.e. via:
	
	sudo apt-get install libvtk5 libvtk5-dev
	
	Depending on your distribution it can be necessary to have also the 
	development versions of JPEG, TIFF and PNG installed.
	
	If you can not install VTK via your package system or on Windows, consult
	the following URI to get binaries or the source for VTK:
	http://www.vtk.org/
	
Installation
============
	To build the vtkX3DLoader example you will have to turn on 
	BUILD_X3DLOADER_EXAMPLES when generating your build environment. CMake will
	try to find your VTK installation or build path. If this is not successfull
	you have to point to your VTK installion using the VTK_DIR setting.
	
	Attention: If you installed VTK using you Linux packaging system, it could 
	be, CMake find the VTK lib in a directory like /usr/lib/vtk-5.0 and fails
	to generate anyway. In this case try to manually point to /usr/lib/vtk 
	using the VTK_DIR variable.
